title: "Retrospective: Next.js Server Side Rendering"
---
- Do you really need to SSR?
- Use response compression - https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/compression
- Measure performance (hydration, bundle sizes, lighthouse)
- `getInitialProps` optimisation is vital
- Apollo cache key optimisation is vital
- Use style components props "very sparingly"
- Memory outside a component is retained over requests
- End to end tests with a mock server
- End to end tests on production build
- Build a client notification system early on
- Never expose secrets
